	<h2>Article on Back Tracking on Medium Sudoku Solver</h2>
	<p>Backtracking is a powerful technique that can be used to solve many combinatorial problems, such as finding all possible solutions of a maze, generating all permutations of a set of elements, or finding all possible combinations of values that satisfy a set of constraints. However, backtracking algorithms can be slow and inefficient when the number of possibilities is very large, and they may also suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To mitigate these issues, backtracking algorithms often incorporate heuristics and optimizations, such as constraint propagation, pruning, and intelligent ordering of variables and values.
